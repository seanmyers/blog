Yesterday (6/20/2022) my friend Conyai graduated from the trades program at the [Independent Contractors Guild (ICG)](https://www.icgofwny.com/). I couldn't be more proud of him.

I met Conyai 9 years ago, when he was 10 years old, as a mentor with the Erie County Big Brother Big Sister program. He was in grade school then and we spent most of our time going to sporting events, going out for lunch, and playing chess. Along the way Conyai was able to learn more about me and I more about him.

As he got older I became busy with my business and in 2018 Deanna and I left Buffalo for Portland, ME so I could focus on the business's growth. We more or less lost touch at that point but we were able to re-connect virtually in the summer of 2020 and eventually in person. Over the past several months Conyai and I have been able to re-establish our bond and have been working hard to get him positioned for the next phase of his life including completing this important training program.

Conyai is someone we would consider a "disadvantaged youth" - meaning they do not have the same opportunities to slide into society like others do. Getting them positioned to succeed takes a lot of work and involves several people and organizations.

First I want to thank [Big Brother and Big Sister of Erie, Niagara, and the Southern Tier](https://bbbsenst.org/) for matching Conyai and myself back in 2013. I also want to give a big shout out to [Pathstone](https://pathstone.org/), [Vauhn-Dane Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vauhn-dane-murray-msw-bsw-7a9432213/), and his staff for all the programmatic and individual help they provided Conyai. This training effort wouldn't have started without them. Finally, I want to thank Renee, Frank, Steve, and Romero and others at [ICG](https://www.icgofwny.com/) for the skilled training they provided and the patience they showed dealing with their students. They are a true asset to WNY and I wish them the best of luck with their next cohort of trainees.
